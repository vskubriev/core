	<description>
	This application enables a set of APIs that external systems can use to create, edit, delete and query user
		attributes, query, set and remove groups, set quota and query total storage used in ownCloud. Group admin users
		can also query ownCloud and perform the same functions as an admin for groups they manage. The API also enables
		an admin to query for active ownCloud applications, application info, and to enable or disable an app remotely.
		Once the app is enabled, http requests can be used via a Basic Auth header to perform any of the functions
		listed above. More information is available in the Provisioning API documentation, including example calls
		and server responses.
